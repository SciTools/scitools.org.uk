          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The Iris and Cartopy projects will be governed with the following approach:
              <ul>
                  <li>An active community contributes to the day-to-day development and upkeep of the project.</li>
                  <li>We expect the community to contribute to decisions through open debate.</li>
                  <li>A benevolent dictator will lead the project and act as final arbitrator on decisions.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <a id="roles"><h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2></a>
          <a id="users"><h3>Users</h3></a>
          <p>Users download and use Iris and/or Cartopy. They are the reason they has been created and developed. We want to 
  know what problems they experience and ideas they have so that we can improve the software. 
  Become a User by downloading the libraries and starting to use them now.</p>
          <a id="contributors"><h3>Contributors</h3></a>
          <p>Contributors are people who contribute to the Iris and/or Cartopy project but do not have sufficient privileges to merge a pull 
  request to the master. Contributions can be made by providing bug fixes, adding new code, reporting bugs, 
  updating or writing new documentation and gallery additions.</p> 
   
  <p>Become a Contributor with any of the tasks described above.  Please note that merging of source 
  code contributions is at the discretion of the Developers and follows an iterative dialogue. We will 
  also need a completed <a href="documents/cla_form.pdf" target="_blank" name="Contributor's Licence Agreement (CLA)">Contributor's Licence Agreement (CLA)</a>.
  Please read the <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank" name="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> to understand how we will use any personal data we collect about you.</p>
   
  <p>We will be following the 'review-then-commit' process of merging contributions into the project.</p>
   
  <p>Major and effective contributors to the project will be invited to become developers by the 
  development lead.</p>
          <a id="developers"><h3>Developers</h3></a>
          <p>Developers are responsible for reviewing and merging Contributors bug fixes, new code and/or 
  documentation from submitted pull requests into the master. They also ensure that everyone who 
  wishes to contribute has submitted a CLA.</p>
          <a id="owners"><h3>Owners</h3></a>
          <p>Owners are responsible for the repository and for granting privileges.</p>
          
          <a id="development_lead"><h3>Development lead</h3></a>
          <p>The Development lead for Iris and Cartopy are a team of developers led by Richard Hattersley (benevolent 
  dictator for Iris) from the Met Office. It is the Development lead's responsibility to ensure the quality of the 
  source code and documentation remains high and that the integrity of the project is preserved. To 
  achieve this, the Development lead will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Define coding standards</li>
            <li>Define development methodologies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Development lead together with representatives from Business, Legal, TIS and Science 
  directorates of the Met Office are currently responsible for the overall direction of the project.</p>
          
          <a id="support"><h2>Support</h2></a>
          <p>Support is offered on a best endeavour only and is provided as time and resources allow. That said  
  support is an important activity for the Developers as it provides an opportunity to work closely with 
  people using Iris. It is from these events that real value is generated that can be brought back into 
  the project. Available support channels for the project can be found at Iris <a href="iris/community.html" name="Iris Community Page">Community Page</a> and on the Cartopy Home page <a href="cartopy/docs/latest/index.html" name="Cartopy Getting Involved">'Getting Involved'</a> section.</p>
