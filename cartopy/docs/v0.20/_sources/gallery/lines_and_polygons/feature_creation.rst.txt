Feature Creation
----------------

This example manually instantiates a
:class:`cartopy.feature.NaturalEarthFeature` to access administrative
boundaries (states and provinces).

Note that this example is intended to illustrate the ability to construct
Natural Earth features that cartopy does not necessarily know about
*a priori*.
In this instance however, it would be possible to make use of the
pre-defined :data:`cartopy.feature.STATES` constant.
