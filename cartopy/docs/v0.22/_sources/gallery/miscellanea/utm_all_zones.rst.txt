Displaying all 60 zones of the UTM projection
---------------------------------------------

This example displays all 60 zones of the Universal Transverse Mercator
projection next to each other in a figure.

First we create a figure with 60 subplots in one row.
Next we set the projection of each axis in the figure to a specific UTM zone.
Then we add coastlines, gridlines and the number of the zone.
Finally we add a supertitle and display the figure.
