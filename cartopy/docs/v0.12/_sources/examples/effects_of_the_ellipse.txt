The effect of badly referencing an ellipse
------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates the effect of referencing your data to an incorrect
ellipse.

First we define two coordinate systems - one using the World Geodetic System
established in 1984 and the other using a spherical globe. Next we extract
data from the Natural Earth land dataset and convert the Geodetic
coordinates (referenced in WGS84) into the respective coordinate systems
that we have defined. Finally, we plot these datasets onto a map assuming
that they are both referenced to the WGS84 ellipse and compare how the
coastlines are shifted as a result of referencing the incorrect ellipse.
