Reprojecting images from a Geostationary projection
---------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates Cartopy's ability to project images into the desired
projection on-the-fly. The image itself is retrieved from a URL and is loaded
directly into memory without storing it intermediately into a file. It
represents pre-processed data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) which has been put into an image in the data's
native Geostationary coordinate system - it is then projected by cartopy
into a global Miller map.
