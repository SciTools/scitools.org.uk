Colouring anomaly data with logarithmic scaling
===============================================

In this example, we need to plot anomaly data where the values have a
"logarithmic" significance  -- i.e. we want to give approximately equal ranges
of colour between data values of, say, 1 and 10 as between 10 and 100.

As the data range also contains zero, that obviously does not suit a simple
logarithmic interpretation.  However, values of less than a certain absolute
magnitude may be considered "not significant", so we put these into a separate
"zero band" which is plotted in white.

To do this, we create a custom value mapping function (normalization) using
the matplotlib Norm class `matplotlib.colours.SymLogNorm
<http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.SymLogNorm>`_.
We use this to make a cell-filled pseudocolour plot with a colorbar.

NOTE: By "pseudocolour", we mean that each data point is drawn as a "cell"
region on the plot, coloured according to its data value.
This is provided in Iris by the functions :meth:`iris.plot.pcolor` and
:meth:`iris.plot.pcolormesh`, which call the underlying matplotlib
functions of the same names (i.e. `matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor
<http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor>`_
and  `matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh
<http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh>`_).
