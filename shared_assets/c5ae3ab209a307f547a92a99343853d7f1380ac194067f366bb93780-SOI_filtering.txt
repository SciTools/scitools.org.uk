.. _General-SOI_filtering:


Applying a filter to a time-series
==================================

This example demonstrates low pass filtering a time-series by applying a
weighted running mean over the time dimension.

The time-series used is the Darwin-only Southern Oscillation index (SOI),
which is filtered using two different Lanczos filters, one to filter out
time-scales of less than two years and one to filter out time-scales of
less than 7 years.
