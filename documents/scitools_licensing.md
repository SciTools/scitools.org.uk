# SciTools Projects

## Licensing

All projects under the SciTools[-incubator] GitHub organisations are to be
developed in the open (i.e. via small pull requests which are open to
public review) and released under an OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved
license.


## Copyright

All SciTools projects operate a shared ownership model as specified
in the SciTools CLA. The copyright statement is:

```
Copyright <start year> (- <end year>) <project> developers
```

## Source preamble

All non-trivial source files in a SciTools repository must reference the
license of the repository. The wording of the preamble should be:

```
# Copyright <project> developers

# This file is part of <project> and is released under a BSD 3-clause license.
# See LICENSE in the root of the repository for full licensing details.
```

**Note:** start and end dates are *not* required in the source preamble


## Default license

The default license for all SciTools projects is the BSD 3-clause license. 
The full text of a BSD 3-clause LICENSE file should be:

```
BSD 3-Clause License

The license must be unmodified except in the situation where
vendored / third-party tools have been packaged into the repository.
As always, due care with licensing *MUST* be taken when vendoring in this way.
Supplimentary license details should be documented at the end of the LICENSE
file. An example of doing so can be seen in the numpy codebase.
