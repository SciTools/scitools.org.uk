"""
Seasonal ensemble model plots
=============================

This example demonstrates the loading of a lagged ensemble dataset from the
GloSea4 model, which is then used to produce two types of plot:

 * The first shows the "postage stamp" style image with an array of 14 images,
   one for each ensemble member with a shared colorbar. (The missing image in
   this example represents ensemble member number 6 which was a failed run)

 * The second plot shows the data limited to a region of interest, in this case
   a region defined for forecasting ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation), which,
   for the purposes of this example, has had the ensemble mean subtracted from
   each ensemble member to give an anomaly surface temperature. In practice a
   better approach would be to take the climatological mean, calibrated to the
   model, from each ensemble member.
