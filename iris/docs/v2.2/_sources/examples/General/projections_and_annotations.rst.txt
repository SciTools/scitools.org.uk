.. _General-projections_and_annotations:


Plotting in different projections
=================================

This example shows how to overlay data and graphics in different projections,
demonstrating various features of Iris, Cartopy and matplotlib.

We wish to overlay two datasets, defined on different rotated-pole grids.
To display both together, we make a pseudocoloured plot of the first, overlaid
with contour lines from the second.
We also add some lines and text annotations drawn in various projections.

We plot these over a specified region, in two different map projections.
