This document explains the new/changed features of Iris in version 1.11
(:doc:`View all changes <index>`.)

Iris 1.11 Features
==================
* If available, display the ``STASH`` code instead of ``unknown / (unknown)`` when printing cubes
  with no ``standard_name`` and no ``units``.
* Support for saving to netCDF with data packing has been added.
* The coordinate system :class:`iris.coord_systems.LambertAzimuthalEqualArea` has been added with NetCDF saving support.

Bugs Fixed
==========
* Fixed a floating point tolerance bug in :func:`iris.experimental.regrid.regrid_area_weighted_rectilinear_src_and_grid`
  for wrapped longitudes.
* Allow :func:`iris.util.new_axis` to promote the nominated scalar coordinate of a cube
  with a scalar masked constant data payload.
* Fixed a bug where :func:`iris.util._is_circular` would erroneously return false
  when coordinate values are decreasing.
* When saving to NetCDF, the existing behaviour of writing string attributes as ASCII has been
  maintained across known versions of netCDF4-python.

Documentation Changes
=====================
* Fuller doc-string detail added to :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.unrotate_pole` and
  :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.rotate_pole`.
