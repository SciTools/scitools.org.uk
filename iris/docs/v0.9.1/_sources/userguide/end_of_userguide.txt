Iris gallery
------------
It can be very daunting to start coding a project from an empty file, that is why you will find many in-depth 
examples in the Iris gallery which can be used as a goal driven reference to producing your own visualisations. 

If you produce a visualisation which you think would add value to the gallery, please get in touch with us and 
we will consider including it as an example for all to benefit from.
