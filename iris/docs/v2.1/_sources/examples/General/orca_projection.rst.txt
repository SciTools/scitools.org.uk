Tri-Polar Grid Projected Plotting
=================================

This example demonstrates cell plots of data on the semi-structured ORCA2 model
grid.

First, the data is projected into the PlateCarree coordinate reference system.

Second four pcolormesh plots are created from this projected dataset,
using different projections for the output image.
