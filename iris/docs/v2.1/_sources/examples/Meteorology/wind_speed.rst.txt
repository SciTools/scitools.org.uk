Plotting wind direction using quiver
===========================================================

This example demonstrates using quiver to plot wind speed contours and wind
direction arrows from wind vector component input data. The vector components
are co-located in space in this case.

For the second plot, the data used for the arrows is normalised to produce
arrows with a uniform size on the plot.
