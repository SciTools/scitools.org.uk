----------

A CF auxiliary coordinate.

..

    .. autoclass:: iris.coords.AuxCoord
        :members:
        :undoc-members:

----------

An immutable representation of a single cell of a coordinate, including the 
sample point and/or boundary position.

Notes on cell comparison:

Cells are compared in two ways, depending on whether they are
compared to another Cell, or to a number/string.

Cell-Cell comparison is defined to produce a strict ordering. If
two cells are not exactly equal (i.e. including whether they both
define bounds or not) then they will have a consistent relative
order.

Cell-number and Cell-string comparison is defined to support
Constraint matching. The number/string will equal the Cell if, and
only if, it is within the Cell (including on the boundary). The
relative comparisons (lt, le, ..) are defined to be consistent with
this interpretation. So for a given value `n` and Cell `cell`, only
one of the following can be true:
    n < cell
    n == cell
    n > cell
Similarly, `n <= cell` implies either `n < cell` or `n == cell`.
And `n >= cell` implies either `n > cell` or `n == cell`.

based on its metadata.
