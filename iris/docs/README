This folder should contain MAJOR.MINOR documentation only.

As of 14/11/2022 an archive was created to keep a zip file of each
Iris release that is not hosted on Read The Docs.  This includes Iris v2.4
and earlier.  The archive is located in /iris/docs/archive.  All built
older documentaiton will then shortly be removed from the repo.
