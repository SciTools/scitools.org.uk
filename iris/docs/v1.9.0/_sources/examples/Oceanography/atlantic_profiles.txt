Oceanographic profiles and T-S diagrams
=======================================

This example demonstrates how to plot vertical profiles of different
variables in the same axes, and how to make a scatter plot of two
variables. There is an oceanographic theme but the same techniques are
equally applicable to atmospheric or other kinds of data.

The data used are profiles of potential temperature and salinity in the
Equatorial and South Atlantic, output from an ocean model.

The y-axis of the first plot produced will be automatically inverted due to the
presence of the attribute positive=down on the depth coordinate. This means
depth values intuitively increase downward on the y-axis.
