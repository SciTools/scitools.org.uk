.. _Meteorology-COP_1d_plot:


Global average annual temperature plot
======================================

Produces a time-series plot of North American temperature forecasts for 2 different emission scenarios.
Constraining data to a limited spatial area also features in this example.

The data used comes from the HadGEM2-AO model simulations for the A1B and E1 scenarios, both of which
were derived using the IMAGE Integrated Assessment Model (Johns et al. 2010; Lowe et al. 2009).
