Seasonal ensemble model plots
=============================

This example demonstrates the loading of a lagged ensemble dataset from the GloSea4 model, which is then used to
produce two types of plot:

 * The first shows the "postage stamp" style image with an array of 14 images, one for each ensemble member with
   a shared colorbar. (The missing image in this example represents ensemble member number 6 which was a failed run)

 * The second plot shows the data limited to a region of interest, in this case a region defined for forecasting
   ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation), which, for the purposes of this example, has had the ensemble mean subtracted
   from each ensemble member to give an anomaly surface temperature. In practice a better approach would be to take the
   climatological mean, calibrated to the model, from each ensemble member.
