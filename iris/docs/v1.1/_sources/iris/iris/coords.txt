----------

An immutable representation of a single cell of a coordinate, including the 
sample point and/or boundary position.

Notes on cell comparison:

Cells can be compared in a number of ways depending on how they are
configured and the data type they are being compared to.

For equality comparison (i.e. checking that a cell is equal to something)
the following rules apply:

1. When comparing to another cell, equality is determined by comparing
   tuples of attribute values from both objects.
    
2. When comparing to a string value and cell point is also a string, string
   comparison is performed.

3. When comparing to an integer or float and the cell has bounds, the result
   is True if the numeric value 'other' is within the cell's bounds.
   Otherwise, the comparison is performed against the cell's point value.

For rich comparisions i.e. (less than, greater than, less than or equals and
greater than or equals) the following rules apply:

1. If either comparison object is a bounded cell, the min or max of its
   bounds are used for comparison. Otherwise, the point value is used.

2. If both comparison objects are bounded cells, the point values are also
   compared.
