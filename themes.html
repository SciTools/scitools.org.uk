      <h1>Roadmap</h1>
      <p>We have outlined the work we intend to consider planning significant product releases for Iris and Cartopy 
      for the next two quarters, with some examples. We will also attempt to outline a very high level overview of 
      the current thinking beyond the next six months in order to show how the next two quarters contributes 
      to the long-term plan.
      </p>
      
      <p>Themes we plan to address are in the next two quarters are:</p>
      <ul>Performance</ul>
      <ul>File Formats</ul>
      <ul>Installation and setup</ul>
      <ul>Interpolation and Regridding</ul>
      
      <h2>Themes</h2>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>Three areas will be addressed with the goal of improving the ‘straight-line’ speed of Iris and Cartopy. 
      These are file I/O, plotting and processing cubes. As a non-functional requirement, performance will be a 
      constant theme in the roadmap, but it has its own theme here as there may be periods of sustained effort 
      planned into certain sprints.</p>
      
      <h3>Data Model</h3>
      <p>Extend the Iris data model to CF version v1.6 and then v1.7. Continue to influence the development of 
      the data model and encourage the Iris science community to contribute to its development. </p>
      
      <h3>Python 3</h3>
		<p>Continue to prepare Iris and Cartopy for Python 3 support and to work with the Science community on 
		when Python 3 support is appropriate.</p>
		
		<h3>Documentation</h3>
		<p>Documentation reviews for Iris and Cartopy will occur both as a reaction to user feedback and requests 
		and as planned expansion to scope and depth.</p>
		
		<h3>File Format Support</h3>
		<p>Currently supported file formats will continue to be developed. User requests for writing of 
		Fieldsfiles is being assessed. Additions to the supported file formats may include BUFR, NAME, ABF, LPAR, 
		Met Office Datapoint, and GeoTiff. A better interface for reading and writing CSV and ASCII files into cubes 
		will also be added.</p>
		
		<h3>Mathematical Support</h3>
		<p>Closer coupling with established libraries such as Pandas will extend the available mathematical 
		support. Where closer coupling is not desired or not possible then we will publish templates to aid users. </p>
		
		<h3>Interpolation and regridding</h3>
		<p>This theme is the focus for the next few sprints and some requirements gathering and analysis has already taken place
		to establish the needs of users in the Iris Google Group. </p>
		
		<h3>Cartopy Enhancements</h3>
		<ul>Annotation (gridlines, ticks, borders, scale bar)</ul> 
		<ul>provision of vector plotting (e.g. "wind arrows" and "streamlines" style)</ul>
		
		<h3>Iris Visualisation</h3>
		<p>Further development of specific scientific visualisations and supporting features. These include:</p>
		<ul>A shared colourbar</ul>
		<ul>Heatmaps</ul>
		<ul>Quick visualisation tool</ul>
		<ul>Plot Custimisation</ul>
		
		<h3>Installation and setup</h3>
		<p>Includes supporting operating system architectures such as Linux, Unix flavours and 
		Mac OS.</p>
		<ul>PyPi</ul>
		<ul>Homebrew</ul>
		<ul>VirtualEnv</ul>
		<ul>Ubuntu apt-get repository deployment</ul>
