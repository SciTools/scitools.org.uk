scitools.org.uk
===============

This is the repository containing content found at scitools.org.uk.
 
Building content for scitools.org.uk
====================================

The content is generated by running the
``build.py`` script at the root of the repository. ``build.py`` takes
the content in ``source`` and ``templates`` and constructs the resulting
html. Both source and build content are stored in this repository.


Adding contributors
===================
``contributors.json`` contains a JSON dictionary of all contributors who have
signed the scitools CLA. It is the definitive source (as rendered in
scitools.org.uk/about.html) of such contributors, and is where core developers
will look when considering whether a PR is ready for merging. If you've signed
the CLA and aren't yet on this list, please consider submitting a PR to speed
the process up. 


Adding built docs
=================

The html in this repository is a combination of generated and static content.
Running the ``build.py`` script will overwrite any static content which shares
a directory structure to that found in ``source``. The built documentation for
documentation such as Iris and cartopy are not generated from the ``source``
directory, and are instead generated with sphinx as a separate step. To add
further released version documentation, create the appropriate folder
(e.g. iris/docs/v1.2.3) with the built documentation (typically created via
sphinx). Once the content is in place, consider running
``tools/symlink_common.py .`` which will look through all files and share any
common assets into the common_assets folder, thus reducing the overall
repository size.
